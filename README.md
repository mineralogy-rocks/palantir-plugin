# Palantir Plugin for Claude Code

A Claude Code plugin that gives your AI assistant persistent memory across sessions.
Stores decisions, findings, errors, and patterns with semantic search and enforced
atomization — so context is never lost when conversations end or compress.

## Prerequisites

You need a running Palantir instance (API only — no MCP server required). Set up from the
[palantir](https://github.com/mineralogy-rocks/palantir) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mineralogy-rocks/palantir.git
cd palantir
docker-compose up -d
```

## Install + Login

```bash
claude plugin install github:mineralogy-rocks/palantir-plugin
export PALANTIR_API_URL=https://palantir.example.com
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR}/.claude/bin/palantir" login
```

That's it. Login registers an OAuth2 client, opens your browser for GitHub auth,
and stores bearer + refresh tokens at `~/.config/palantir/credentials.json` (mode 600).
Re-running login reuses the registered client — no duplicate client rows.

For local development/testing without installing:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/palantir-plugin
```

## Configuration

Set `PALANTIR_API_URL` in your shell profile to skip the prompt on each login:

```bash
export PALANTIR_API_URL=http://palantir.local:81
```

## What the plugin does

The plugin acts as a middleware layer between the AI agent and Palantir. It enforces
**atomization** — breaking complex knowledge into discrete, standalone,
individually-searchable entries — before anything is written. It also ensures
duplicate checks, tag reuse, correct kind classification, and standalone BLUF summaries.

All Palantir operations go through a single CLI at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR}/.claude/bin/palantir`
that calls the REST API directly using a bearer token refreshed automatically on expiry. Any
agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, …) can invoke it with the same credentials.

When a plan is approved in `/plan` mode, an async hook sends a deferred reminder
to save the plan to Palantir during a natural pause — implementation starts immediately.

## Skill

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/palantir` | Unified middleware for all Palantir operations — stores entries, saves plans, searches knowledge, manages tasks |

The skill routes by intent:

| Intent | Protocol |
|--------|----------|
| Store knowledge ("remember this", "log this") | Write Protocol |
| Save an approved plan | Plan Protocol |
| Search/recall ("what do we know about X") | Search Protocol |
| Create/update tasks | Task Protocol |

## Hook

| Event | Matcher | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **PostToolUse** | `ExitPlanMode` | Async deferred reminder to save the approved plan to Palantir |

    _auth.py                           # Credentials, token refresh, authed HTTP
    _common.py                         # Output formatting and shared helpers
```

## How it works

Palantir stores knowledge as **entries** — discrete units covering one topic each.
Each entry has:
- A **BLUF** (Bottom Line Up Front) — 1-2 sentence summary
- **Content** — full context (100-400 words)
- **Kind** — `decision`, `finding`, `error`, `pattern`, `note`, `review`, or `machine-plan`
- **Tags** — for categorization and retrieval

Entries are embedded for semantic search using dual embeddings (content + BLUF)
merged via Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

**Plans** store approved plans with atomized `machine-plan` entries.

**Tasks** group related entries and track work status
(`planning` -> `ready` -> `wip` -> `review` -> `done`).

## Manual hook setup (without the plugin)

If you want plan persistence without installing the full plugin, add to your
project's `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "ExitPlanMode",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "sleep 5 && echo 'Plan approved. Invoke the palantir skill to save it during a natural pause.' >&2 && exit 2",
            "asyncRewake": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook runs in the background (`asyncRewake`). After 5 seconds it exits with
code 2, which wakes Claude with a system reminder. By then the agent is already
implementing and treats the save as a deferred task.

## Changes from v2

- **Unified CLI**: Replaced the MCP server dependency (and, in v3.1, the seven per-domain bash
  wrappers) with a single `palantir` CLI covering entry / task / plan / search / tag / login /
  logout. Any agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, …) can invoke it directly.
- **No MCP server**: Removed `palantir-mcp` container from the Palantir stack — one fewer
  service, ~30x fewer tool-surface tokens.
- **Auto token refresh**: `_auth.py` refreshes the bearer token on 401 transparently.
- **Permission allowlist**: `settings.json` pre-approves subcommands; `logout` still prompts.
- **Version**: 3.1.0 (breaking — per-domain `.sh` scripts removed; settings.json / skill / rules
  updated to use `palantir <subcommand>`).
